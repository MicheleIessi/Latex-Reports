\chapter{Definitions}

The purpose of this chapter is to provide definitions relevant for this work.

\section{Synthesis}
In this work, the word \emph{Synthesis} is used to describe the process of translation from
a high level programming language (e.g.: \texttt{C}) to a Hardware Description Language (e.g.:
VHDL or Verilog).

\section{Kernel}
For this work, the word \emph{Kernel} is used to describe a computation module used by
the FPGA. The number of kernels needed for the target application is variable. Each kernel is represented
by a pool of CLBs (\emph{Configurable Logic Blocks}) connected together
in order to provide a target functionality (e.g.: multiplication, addition)

\section{Initiation Interval}
The \emph{Initiation Interval} is the number of clock cycles between the start times of consecutive loop iterations.
